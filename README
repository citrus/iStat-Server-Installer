Just a simple shell script that automates the installation of iStat Server..


First, make sure you have libxml2-dev installed!! It's required by iStatServer


To install:

cd ~/sources # or your preferred source directory

git clone git://github.com/citrus/iStat-Server-Installer.git

cd iStat-Server-Installer/


--- edit istat.conf to your liking

sudo sh ./istatserver.sh install




You might have to add a rule to your iptables too to allow the connection..
